            <p>The scribe of ms Vatican  marks deletions in several ways: a horizontal line striking through the word; a horizontal line above the word; dots above the word; diagonal strokes etc.
            </p>
            <p>The Vatican scribe usually corrects errors on top of the word:</p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/deletions_1.png"> - Here the scribe wrote “אומר” - the next word in the text - and then corrected to  “תחלה”.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/deletions_2.png"> -  Here the scribe erased the word “את” that does not appear in the text with two diagonal lines above.
            </p>
            <p><strong>In order to signal that a word or letter in the manuscript has been deleted, mark the text using the mouse and then press on the (-) button under the text box.</strong></p>
            <p>Alternatively, press the delete button and then type the deleted text between parentheses.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/deletions_3.png"> - Here the deletion should be marked    כרכי (הים) סדום</p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/deletions_4.png"> - Here the scribe wrote א and then corrected to ע.

            <p>Additions can be either <i>interlinear</i> (above or below the line) or <i>marginal</i> (in the margins).</p>
            <p>The scribe of ms Vatican usually inserts additions above the line if they are short, while longer passages are added in the margins.</p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/additions_1.png"> - Here, the scribe has inserted the word לו that was inadvertently deleted during copying.</p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/additions_2.png"> - Here the word צדקו was added in the margin and its accurate position was marked in above the line, after למען.</p>
            
            <p><strong>In order to signal an addition, press the [+] button below the text line and then write the added word between the brackets. If you want to signal that a transcribed word or letter should rather be handled as addition, please mark that word or letter with your mouse and then click on the [+] button.</strong> For example,</p>
            <p><img src="/ms/vatican44_vol1/images/marked/additions_3.png"> - The addition should be marked: אתה [רוצה] להודיע </p>

            <p>Manuscripts were damaged over the years. Sometimes they may be torn, and sometimes the ink was erased/blurred.</p>
            <p><strong>In order to mark unidentified letters (torn/blurred), press on the “damaged” button </> and insert spaces between square brackets according to the estimated number of missing/unclear letters. For  example:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>In order to mark the uncertainty, use the mouse to mark the uncertain letter and then press the “doubtful” button {?}. Alternatively, you can press the button and type the most probable option between curly brackets.</strong> For example:</p>
