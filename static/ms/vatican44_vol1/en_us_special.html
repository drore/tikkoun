        <div class="title">Line fillers</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In order to maintain a homogeneous text layout, medieval scribes frequently used “line fillers”, special characters added at the end of lines in cases where the text did not reach the end of line naturally. Another way was filling the remaining space with the first letter(s) of the word of the next line.</p>
            <p>The scribe of the Vatican manuscript usually fills the end of lines with a mark that looks like “V” and sometimes with diagonal line.</p>

            <p><strong>In order to insert these characters at the end of a line, press the leftmost button at the buttons line under the text and select the V symbol or /</strong></p>

            <p>Another way to fill the rest of the line is to write very large letters at the end of the lines. These letters need to be written as regular letters and do not require any special character or marking. For example:</p>

            <p>Instead commas and full stops used today, the author of Vatican  manuscript separated sentences using upper dots, one or two.:</p>

            <p>Due to the sanctity of the divine name, scribes avoided to write two complete letters aleph lamed in continuation and wrote a ligature, a sign joining both letters, instead. We use for this the corresponding special sign ﭏ (note the little flag on the top left of the aleph). </p>
            <p>Vatican scribe minimizes the use of this ligature and usually writes the letters regularly:</p>
